# Rust Workshop Invitation

Hi there!
So you are (considering to) participate in the Rust workshop?
Great!

Please read the following to make sure the workshop is a success for you.

## Prerequisites

This workshop requires that you have basic programming skills.
Further, it expects you to know the basics of manual memory management.
Rust has an innovative approach to memory management, so knowledge of the prior art is required.
If the words stack, heap, `malloc` and `free` ring a bell, you're golden!

## Time investment

The workshop consists of a two-hour session every week for six weeks.
The sessions will be a mix of theory and practice, depending on what makes sense for the session.

There will be a flexible amount of homework each week, depending on how much time you can and want to invest.
1. You are expected to finish any exercises that were part of the session but couldn't be completed in time.
1. You are highly encouraged to do a small amount of homework to strengthen what was learned.
1. For those who want to get the most out of the workshop, there will be more time-consuming bonus tasks.

Expect to spend an additional two hours per week on homework.

## What to expect

- You will get an overview of what the language has to offer and how to find all the information you need.
- You will get hands-on experience with all of the core language features solving purpose-built exercises.
- You will spend enough time with Rust's standout features to understand and experience how they uniquely empower you to write great software.
- You will learn how to find, evaluate and use libraries to get things done quickly.
- You will learn about CI/CD tools to kickstart your next Rust project using state-of-the-art engineering practices.

Finally, employing everything you've learned, you will collaborate in a group writing a production-ready piece of composable software, like a CLI tool or network service.

## What to prepare

You don't need to prepare anything.
But there is one thing you can do to make the start of the workshop a little smoother for you.
You can follow the [official instructions](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) for installing the Rust toolchain on your laptop.
(And don't forget to bring that laptop to the workshop! ðŸ˜‰)
