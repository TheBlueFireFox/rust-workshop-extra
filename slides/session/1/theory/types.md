# Floating-point types

IEEE-754

```rust
let x = 2.0; // default: 64-bit
let y: f32 = 3.0; // 32-bit
```

---

```yaml
layout: center
transition: slide-up
```

# Arithmetic operators

```rust
let x = 1 + 2 - 3 * 4 / 5 % 6;
```

---

```yaml
layout: center
transition: slide-up
```

# Booleans

```rust
let x = true;
let y: bool = false;
```

---

```yaml
layout: center
transition: slide-up
```

# Characters

unicode, UTF-8, always 32-bit

```rust
// notice the single quotes
let x = 'a';
let y: char = 'æ¼¢';
let heart_eyed_cat = 'ðŸ˜»';
```

# Tuples

```rust {1|1,3|1,4|all}
let tup: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);

let (x, y, z) = tup; // destructuring
let a: i32 = tup.0;  // indexing
```

# The empty tuple

also known as "unit type"

```rust
let rusty_void: () = println!("printing doesn't return anything");
```

```yaml
layout: center
```

# Arrays

size known at compile time

```rust {1|2|3|all}
let a: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let a = [3; 5]; // initialize all element with the same value
let x = a[0];   // indexing
```
